            <article id="faq1">
                <h3>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8).</p>
                <p>A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting.</p>
                <p>Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even true!</p>

                <h3>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h3>
                <p>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.</p>
                <p>Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</p>

                <h3>Box Canyon/Henry’s Fork of the Snake River</h3>
                <p>Box Canyon in Island Park is a very popular stretch of the Henry’s Fork of the Snake River. The water lets out of Island Park Reservoir and flows down through Harriman State Park and onto the ever-so-popular Mesa Falls. This can be a difficult stretch of water to fish without a drift boat. The banks can be tight and the water fast. However, if timed right, it can be both beautiful and rewarding. Like most rivers in Idaho, expect a lot of trout, including rainbow, cutthroat, and brown.</p>

                <h3>Warm River</h3>
                <p>The Warm River flows into the Henry’s Fork of the Snake River not far downstream from Mesa Falls. Many people know it by the campground, as well as the fish feeding area. Warm River can be a tricky section of river to fish because there are many who land monster trout, yet I have never been able to do so. Big, fat rainbow trout reside in that river. However, they are seasoned veterans and know the difference between bait and real food. It can take some skill to bring in a big one on Warm River, but it can be done. Expect mostly rainbow trout with a couple other varieties, as well as the occasional mountain whitefish.</p>

                <h3>Teton River</h3>
                <p>Both the north and south forks of the Teton can be great to fish. The Teton River is largely known in the Rexburg area for the great flood of 1976. The Teton is one of the most accessible rivers to fish close to Rexburg. Not only for its proximity, but also due to the ability to wade and fish from the banks. Again, like most rivers in this region, it’s a blue ribbon trout river. You’re almost certain to have a good day on either fork of the Teton. You can expect to catch a decent amount of medium-sized trout, with an occasional hog thrown in the mix. It’s beautiful to fish in the early fall and you can catch some great sunsets in the evenings.</p>
