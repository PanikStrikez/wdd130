            <h3 class="overview">Overview</h3>
            <p>One of the signature features of hero shooters like Marvel Rivals is the ability to transform your team comps on the fly throughout a match.
                
                This allows you to adapt according to your team's needs, to counter the enemy team, to the current position of the map, and so on.
                
                In general you can mix and match the roles as need, but make sure to have at least 2 Strategists as there isn't a hero that can solo heal just yet.
                
                In this guide, we'll cover different team comps and how they work so you can understand the right situations for each.</p>

                     <h3>Triple Strategist</h3>
                     <P>Triple Support abuses the power of Strategist ultimate and healing uptime to outsustain your enemies. It's been a rising choice in the Season 1 meta and evokes feelings of the GOATs meta of Overwatch (although it isn't anywhere as bad). 
                    The main components are a solo tank that can anchor the frontline, two DPS, and three Strategists ideally with at least two that have defensive ultimates.
                    Cycling the three defensive ults is the key to the success of a triple Strategist comp. Each Strategist must use their ults one at a time. Combined the team can have around 40 seconds total of healing ultimates. If two supports accidentally use their ults at the same time, the strength of the comp suddenly falls apart.

                    <h3>Anti Triple Support</h3>
                    <p>In response to the rising popularity of Triple Strategist comps, new metas have been developed specifically to counter their high amounts of healing. The focus of this team is trading out defensive ults for the ability to KO through any amount of healing. 
                    Groot and Moon Knight farm their ults and combo them together. Not even Luna or Mantis' ult can survive against the combo so it's a guaranteed fight win when they land it.
                    Thor uses Awakening Rune to constantly pressure the 3 enemy Strategists. His damage is high enough to burst through their healing allowing him to secure elims when no ults are being used. Rocket's C.Y.A. damage boost empowers Thor's ult to one-shot all heroes with 300HP or less.
                    Magneto simultaneously enables and counters Cloak & Dagger. When the enemy C&D ults, he can easily KO her with his ult. If his C&D is ulting, then using his ally bubble shield is the best ability to keep them alive against the enemy's attack.</p>

                <div>
                      <h3>Gamma Charge</h3>
                     <p>
                    Built around the incredible power of the Incredible Hulk's Gamma Team-Up, this team comp plays for high bursts of damage from Iron Man and Strange. Iron Man's Gamma Overdrive Unibeam is the main power of this comp due to its high dps.
                    Psylocke can help deal with hitscans trying to counter Iron Man. She also excels at harassing the backline if the rest of the team is focused on the Vanguards. Cloak and Mantis utilize their healing and offensive abilities to empower their teammates.
                    Both teams plan their attacks and defense around the long duration and cooldown Gamma Overdrive. Defenders have to kite the attack since it can kill through almost any healing in the game. The Gamma team attacking want to save their resources to time their aggressive attacks with Iron Man.</p>

                    <h3>Dive</h3>
                     <p>Dive comps become more popular at higher levels of play. The strategy is to form a full team around heroes who can all quickly engage and attack a selected target and inflict a burst of damage too high for the enemy to survive. has become one of the strongest methods of winning team fights.
                    The most important abilities for Vanguards and Duelists in a Dive comp is mobility to traverse the map, bypass the enemy front line, and then escape to safety after executing their target. All four of these heroes possess similar levels of mobility that enable them to suddenly attack from multiple angles all at once.
                    Mantis’s damage boost helps to ensure her allies can inflict enough damage to actually secure the eliminations. Rocket spams healing orbs toward the enemy team where his allies are about to arrive. He and Mantis also have a high level of self survivability which is needed to stay alive during their teams dive. </p>
